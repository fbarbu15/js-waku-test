- Use webpack to build UMD bundle of the library, see [README](./README.md) for usage.

### Changed

- **Breaking**: Renamed `WakuStore.QueryOptions`'s `direction` to `pageDirection` (and its type) as it only affects the page ordering,
  not the ordering of messages with the page.

### Fixed

  Changed the API to allow retrieval of bootstrap nodes from other sources.
- Examples: Renamed `eth-dm` to `eth-pm`; "Direct Message" can lead to confusion with "Direct Connection" that
  refers to low latency network connections.
- Examples (eth-pm): Use sign typed data EIP-712 instead of personal sign.
- Upgraded dependencies to remove warning at installation.
- **Breaking**: Moved `DefaultPubSubTopic` to `waku.ts` and fixed the casing.
- **Breaking**: Rename all `pubsubTopic` occurrences to `pubSubTopic`, across all interfaces.

### Removed

  Several examples now cover usage of Waku Relay and Waku Store making cli-chat example obsolete;
  web-chat POC should be preferred to use the [TOY-CHAT](https://rfc.vac.dev/spec/22/) protocol.
- `ChatMessage` has been moved from js-waku to web-chat example;
  it is a type used for the [TOY-CHAT](https://rfc.vac.dev/spec/22/) protocol;

- Upgrade libp2p to 0.32.0.
- **Breaking**: Rename `keepAlive` option to `pingKeepAlive`.
- Introduced new `relayKeepAlive` option on `Waku` with a default to 59s to send ping messages over relay to ensure the relay stream stays open.
  This is a workaround until [js-libp2p#744](https://github.com/libp2p/js-libp2p/issues/744) is done as there are issues when TCP(?) timeouts and the stream gets closed
  ([#185](https://github.com/status-im/js-waku/issues/185), [js-libp2p#939](https://github.com/libp2p/js-libp2p/issues/939))

- Test: Introduce testing in browser environment (Chrome) using Karma.
- Add support for Waku Message version 1: Asymmetric encryption, symmetric encryption, and signature of the data.

### Changed

- **Breaking**: Auto select peer if none provided for store and light push protocols.
- Upgrade to `libp2p@0.31.7` and `libp2p-gossipsub@0.10.0` to avoid `TextEncoder` errors in ReactJS tests.
- Disable keep alive by default as latest nim-waku release does not support ping protocol.
- **Breaking**: Optional parameters for `WakuMessage.fromBytes` and `WakuMessage.fromUtf8String` are now passed in a single `Options` object.
- **Breaking**: `WakuMessage` static functions are now async to allow for encryption and decryption.
- **Breaking**: `WakuMessage` constructor is now private, `from*` and `decode*` function should be used.
- `WakuMessage` version 1 is partially supported, enabling asymmetrical encryption and signature of messages;
  this can be done by passing keys to `WakuMessage.from*` and `WakuMessage.decode*` methods.
- Examples (eth-dm): Use Waku Message version 1 encryption scheme instead of `eth-crypto`.
- Examples (eth-dm): Use Protobuf for direct messages instead of JSON ([#214](https://github.com/status-im/js-waku/issues/214)).

  when using `Waku.create`.
- **Breaking**: Options passed to `Waku.create` used to be passed to `Libp2p.create`;
  Now, only the `libp2p` property is passed to `Libp2p.create`, allowing for a cleaner interface.
- Examples (cli chat): Use tcp protocol instead of websocket.

### Added

- Enable access to `WakuMessage.timestamp`.
- Examples (web chat): Use `WakuMessage.timestamp` as unique key for list items.
